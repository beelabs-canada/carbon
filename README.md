# Carbon
A minimalistic build oriented script for the hardened web mason. 

## Why another builder
There are so many great tools and builders out there, and I encourage anyone to try them out as well. Carbon was a bit of a programming adventure into a perl concept called #Modulinos# that I wanted to explore. Since I had a few web projects that needed to be completed and alot of them required a build engine that was simple and with an older technology (yet Perl ftw), I decided to create one.

## The basics
Carbon is driven by a ```<nameofexectuable>.yml``` file that contains the instructions it is going to need to do. The name of the file of the executable is the name that is used to prefix the *.yml* extension creating the config filename expected.
### Examples
* carbon -> carbon.yml
* setup -> setup.yml
